# OfflineRealityVSOnline
Somewhere in the timelapse between the creation of the internet until now, society has become slave of digital enviroment. Is now common to see everyone stucked into their devices, reading mails, checking Facebook, using Twitter to get into trends, instagraming their sorroundings and even preferring texting via whatsapp than talking to each others.
Offline reality became somehow irrelevant to our existance, we are too immersed in what other are living , eating, wearing, talking and spreading that we forget how important human interaction is. 
Let's took this example to display how important is our online reality nowadays, we arrive to any place asking first for their internet password to search for recommendatios from the place, and not just ask for them to the people that is part of that place.
Somehow life on the internet has become much more important and relevant than what happens in real life, lets be honest if it wasn't for facebook only a few people would congratulate each other on their birthday, on the other hand if someone dies how honest could it be that someone gives his/her condolences via inbox instead of even calling the person who lost someone. People don't cry when something bad happens not before they post it on FB, they don't enjoy anger because before anything they have to post it, people don't make dinners or meals to announce their marriage because FB gives you the option to announce it even if it is not real. 
Everybody is aware of this situation but they just don't care or they are too busy on Twitter or Instagram too stop for a minute and look what is going on around them, their dogs getting excited when they arrive, their kids playing, their couples telling them how much they love them. When does being stunned on a screen became more real than what goes on around us? And how is this affecting us?
Now , it would be important to ask if indeed the online world and are totally disconnected or offline are exclusive of each other . That is, the digital world has grown so much that we migrated reality virtuality without questioning whether it is valid or not, because in the end it is a fact , but why it costs so much work to understand and assimilate the relationship can be also in vice versa. Why is so questionable to migrate virtuality, " the real world "?
Many ideas about the difference between what is online and what is real, born of the fallacy that we are on the internet and other in real life , but differences persist even if in real life .
It is also important to note that what defines what is real or not is not a question of actual existence , but functionality. An e -mail is much more functional than a postcard .
